## About Me

I work full-time in maintaining [Apache APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix). Formerly, I maintained two [CNCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Native_Computing_Foundation) projects.

I work primarily on cloud native/Kubernetes, API gateways, and service meshes. I [write](/categories/featured/) and occasionally give [talks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUVkO7d15olRgs1rU6scvszk0DB5HxKdu).

The lines between my work and personal life are blurry, but outside of this, I enjoy reading, playing my bass, and riding my motorcycles. If you want to know more about me, here's [my story](/story/).
