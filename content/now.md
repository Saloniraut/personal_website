Here's what I'm doing now.

## Traveling to Singapore

I will be in Singapore from 9th to 17th February. The plan is to stay faithful to my ability to work from anywhere.

I originally planned the trip to speak at a conference, but it got postponed, and I always book the cheapest, non-refundable tickets. So Singapore, here I come!

I plan to travel around, meet people, and try many different foods. Working from a new city for a while will be a nice change of pace and could help improve my work.

## Traveling to Bahrain

I'm fulfilling my lifelong dream of watching a Formula 1 race live. I will be in Bahrain on the race weekend (2nd to 6th March).

## Full-Time Job

I work full-time at API7.ai, where I help build Apache APISIX.

Apache APISIX is an open source, high-performance, cloud native API gateway.

I work to ensure that APISIX's users have the best experience using APISIX. I also travel a lot to talk to more people about APISIX.

## Blog and Newsletter

I write on this blog about my work and my other projects. I also send biweekly newsletters to a couple of hundred people.

I don't plan to work on these full-time or scale and monetize them, at least for now.

## Reading

I'm currently reading the novel "The Maid" by Nita Prose. I like thriller novels; they are my go-to genre when I'm in a reading slump.

I'm also reading "The Anarchy" by William Dalrymple. It talks about the East India Company and how it rose to power against Indian kingdoms.

I like learning history. I'm terrible at it, and I have been improving my knowledge by reading more history books.

I have also been using [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/navendu4) for articles and newsletters. It works really well. I will create a public list of my subscriptions soon.

## Side Projects and Hobbies

I'm not working on any side projects now. But I have a big "Ideas" document that I find myself updating constantly.

A lot of my hobbies, like playing my bass guitar, have reduced significantly. I plan to spend more time on my hobbies after a few months.
